					<h3>CAR X  mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h3>
					<p>
						CAR X was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, car-x builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Car-x believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.
						
						Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Car-x cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Car-X designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S – which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Car-x expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway comfortable truck ever – Car-x Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, Car-x unveiled Model Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.</p>
